I see three ways:

- we could make a detailed PHPSpec test for that (but it can be a pain in the neck, to be honest)
- we could create a unit test with PHPUnit with some most well-known use-cases (one field without nesting, two fields with one-level nesting, one field with two-levels nesting, etc.)
- indeed create some test application, but we must be aware that it would require a lot of additional code - it's not a plugin but a bundle, it does not have a test application already inside

I would personally give a try for the 2nd way (even though I'm not 100% sure will it work smoothly ðŸš€) and maybe think about other ways it fails. cc @pamil your opinion would be significant ðŸ––

Just for the record, there is a sample app: https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusGridBundle/tree/master/src/Bundle/test

My bad ðŸ˜„ ðŸ–– Still, the PHPUnit test can be sufficient (or not, but we should check it out)

For now, I've added a PHPSpec test and I hope it can be merged in this form.

Additionally, I've added an issue with missing proper tests (https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusGridBundle/issues/4) and I'll try to take care of it in the nearest future.
