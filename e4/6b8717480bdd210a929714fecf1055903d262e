What's wrong with just disabling them?

@vvasiloi disabling things when configuring a grid with yaml is not that bad I guess. The thing is, when configuring a grid in php with the `GridBuilder`, the `removeField(...)` and the other methods are misleading because they just don't work for things from the extended grid.

I mean, if we take a look at how Symfony form component works, we can remove forms from extended types with a dedicated method. IMO this should work in the same way and as I see it, disabling things is kind of a hack.

That's really awesome. I think a PHPUnit test with an extended grid and a removed field is missing.

@Florian-Merle Dors that work with no grid inheritance, just updating an existing grid configuration

In a first file configuration

```YAML
sylius_admin_grid:
    fields:
        name:
            type: string
```
In a second file configuration

```YAML
sylius_admin_grid:
    fields:
        removals:
            fields: ['name']
```

I had also mixed feelings about it, but [this comment](https://github.com/Sylius/SyliusGridBundle/pull/264#issuecomment-1250600647) convinced me it's a good way to go. I believe we can deprecate the `disable` option (as it indeed does the same as removals, at least in yaml) and remove it in potential 2.0. But still, this feature seems valuable.

One more thing, we do not have the documentation for that :dancer: So it's another thing that can be done in a separated PR ðŸ––

Btw, I've allowed myself to fix the comment I left above, I will merge it when it's green ðŸš€
